You can win or lose sometimes playing my game, but there's a caveat.
Because the red ghost is constantly chasing you, and spawns at middle, if you collect pellets near middle first, you will likely lose.
If you collect pellets near the boundaries first, green obstacles will protect you, and you will have enough points to tank the red ghost near the end.
